    <p>
      Hello, I am Giovanni Perez but feel free to call me Gio. I am currently
      majoring in Software Engineering. I am from Tucson, Arizona and was living
      in Merida, Yucatan until recently. Hobby wise I like board/card games,
      reading, going out with friends, hiking, and cooking. I am not married,
      contrary to populary belief.

      I am taking this course for a certificate in my degree. I also figured
      this class would be pretty useful in real life wether it be for jobs or
      personal reasons. I have been a member since I was about 8 years old. Both
      my parents are converts so it was wonderful seeing them change as I grew
      up. My favorite talk is "The First Great Commandment" by Elder Holland and
      I served a mission in Mexico City, Mexico.
